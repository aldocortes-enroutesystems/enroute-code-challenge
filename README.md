# Enroute test

This is the documentation for a coding challenge provided for Enroute Systems.

The project has two separated folders, front end and back end.

Is **very recommended** that first you enable the backend in order to run  the front end.


The documentation for the **back end** can be located at this [place](./enroute-test-backend/README.md).


The documentation for the **front end** is in this [place](./enroute-test-frontend/README.md).

Thank you very much!
